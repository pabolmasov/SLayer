\begin{abstract}
In standard accretion discs, outward angular momentum transfer by viscous
forces is compensated by the inward motion of the accreting matter. 
%Matter is usually (but not necessarily) supposed to move inwards everywhere in
%the disc, independently of the vertical coordinate.
However, the vertical structure of real accretion discs leads to meridional
circulation with comparable amplitudes of poloidal velocities. Using thin-disc
approximation, we consider different regimes of disc accretion with different
vertical viscosity scalings. We show that, while gas-pressure-dominated discs
can easily have a midplane outflow, standard thin radiation-pressure-dominated
disc is normally moving inwards at all the heights. 
However, quasi-spherical scaling for pressure
($p\propto \varpi^{-5/2}$) leads to a midplane outflow for a very broad range
of parameters. It particular, this may lead to a reversed, outward heat
advection in geometrically thick discs when the temperature decreases rapidly
enough with hight. While the overall direction of heat advection depends on
the unknown details of vertical structure and viscosity mechanisms, existence
of the midplane counterflow in quasi-spherical flows is a robust result weakly
dependent on the parameters and the assumptions of the model. Future models of
thick radiatively inefficient flows should take meridional circulation into
account.

\section{Introduction}

One of the main assumptions of the standard thin disc approach \citep{SS73} is
locality of energy release: all the heat dissipated inside an annulus is
promptly radiated from the surface. This assumption works well as long as {\it
  (i)} the geometrical thickness of the disc is small (that ensures relatively
strong vertical gradients of the principal physical quantities) and {\it (ii)}
energy dissipation time scales are smaller than the time scales of radial
motion. Violation of the first assumption makes radiation transport more
complex, as the radiation energy density gradient is no more vertical and
diffusion coefficient variations with radius also become
significant. Violation of the second approximation due to either low
emissivity (as in radiatively inefficient advection-dominated flows, see
\citealt{NY95}) or high optical depth (as in slim discs, see
\citealt{abram88,slim}) means that the radial heat advection is important. 
Energy dissipated at some radius is then either emitted from some other
portion of the disc, or absorbed by the black hole, making the flow
radiatively inefficient. 

In steady-state accretion flows, as the mechanical energy of the flow is
transformed into heat and radiation, the matter should in general move
inwards, which makes it logical to assume that advection transports energy
inwards with the radial velocity of the flow. There are however indications
for non-trivial radial velocity profiles in certain types of accretion
discs. In particular, for isothermal, gas-pressure-dominated discs, it was
shown already by \citet{urpin84} that the radial velocity can easily have the
opposite (positive, if negative corresponds to inward motion) sign near the
equatorial plane. This finding was confirmed by numerical simulations
\citep{fromang11,stollkley,rafikov} and seems to be a usual feature for thin
disc solutions with local, Newtonian-type viscosity, expected in
protoplanetary discs around young stars. As it was shown by
\citet{rafikov}, equation (6), equatorial-plane radial velocity is sensitive
not to the vertically-integrated viscous stress, as vertically-averaged radial
velocity in the standard model, but to the local viscous stress ${\rm
  w}_{\varpi \varphi}$ and its dependence on radial (cylindrical) coordinate
$\varpi$. More specifically, if ${\rm w}_{\varpi\varphi} \varpi^2$ decreases
with $\varpi$, one should expect an equatorial-plane outflow.
In discs powered by accretion, this effect can alter the sign of the advection
term in energy equation. In contrast with protoplanetary discs, temperature in
accretion discs tends to decrease strongly with height, hence it is most
likely that the matter bearing most of the heat is moving inwards at a
lower-than-average velocity or, perhaps, even moves outwards. 

In local Newtonian-type viscosity approach, where the stress is proportional
to the strain, one should also take into account the angular
velocity dependence on vertical coordinate. 
Even though for thin discs angular frequency changes only slightly with
height,
its second vertical derivative is of the same order as the second order radial
derivative, and thus may contribute significantly to angular
momentum transport. This effect makes the angular momentum transport problem
more complicated, but is straightforward to account for in certain assumptions
about the vertical structure. 

In gas-dominated parts of a standard disc, pressure decreases with radius
rapidly enough to suggest a midplane outflow, if viscous stress scales
linearly with pressure (the approach we will hereafter call local
$\alpha$-assumption). However, the effects of advection are very small in
gas-dominated discs. 
On the other hand, simple dimensional arguments suggest that, whenever
advection is strong and accretion disc becomes thick, the speed of sound
scales with virial velocity $c_{\rm s} \propto \varpi^{-1/2}$, and pressure
becomes a very steep function of radius, $p\propto \varpi^{-5/2}$, which is
strongly suggestive for existence of a midplane outflow in any type of a thick
disc. 

It is of course difficult to extrapolate the results obtained in thin-disc
approximation to geometrically thick flows. However, it is possible to make
estimates for the midplane radial velocity which do not rely much on the
assumption of disc thickness. 
%As we will see later, such estimates agree that strong enough pressure
%decrease with distance implies radial velocity reversal near the equatorial
%plane. 

The goals of this paper are to estimate the vertical rotational structure and
two-dimensional angular momentum transport in thin accretion discs where the
vertical and radial structure may be decoupled, and to use this approach to
estimate the direction of heat advection in different kinds of accretion discs
and flows. In Section~\ref{sec:gene}, we formulate the problem and introduce
the notation used throughout the paper. Then, in Section~\ref{sec:rot}, we
calculate the vertical structure of the angular frequency field. In
Section~\ref{sec:angmo} we use different local viscosity models to recover the
expected angular momentum transfer and the poloidal velocity field. In
Section~\ref{sec:heat}, we show that existence of a midplane outflow in an
accretion disc often leads to outward advection of the energy stored as
trapped radiation. In Section~\ref{sec:disc}, we discuss the validity of the
assumptions used and consider the consequences of the results for particular accretion disc models. 

\section{Basic assumptions and notation}\label{sec:gene}

We will use cylindrical coordinates $z$ and $\varpi$, where $z$ is the height
above the equatorial plane, and $\varpi$ is the distance towards the axis. We
assume stationarity and axisymmetry. Poloidal velocity components are always
negligible in comparison with the azimuthal component $v_\varphi = \varpi
\Omega$. We assume that above the finite height of $z=H$, density and pressure
in the accretion disc become zero. We will also neglect all the terms of the
order $\left(H/\varpi\right)^2$ and higher in dynamical equations, and assume
that, for every physical quantity $f=f(\varpi, z)$, it is possible to separate
the variables as $f=f_\varpi(\varpi) f_z(z/H(\varpi))$. Besides, all the
radial dependences are assumed smooth and approximated by power laws using
notation $f_\varpi \propto \varpi^{-\Gamma_f}$. Rotation velocity $\Omega$ is
assumed close to Keplerian $\Omega_{\rm K} = \sqrt{GM} \varpi^{-3/2}$ with
accuracy $\sim \left(H/\varpi\right)^2$. As the angular momentum transfer
equation for Newtonian-type viscosity contains second vertical derivatives of
angular frequency $\partial^2\Omega/\partial z^2 \sim \Omega / H^2$, vertical
variations of rotation velocity, though negligibly small by themselves,
produce significant terms in angular momentum transport equations.


The set of assumptions we use is supposed to reproduce the main properties of the standard $\alpha$-disc after vertical integration.
%includes the standard accretion disc model as the particular case of $\alpha$-viscosity and local energy release. 
Strong deviations from the standard model may arise in the models where the viscous stress does not zero at the surface of the disc that implies angular momentum exchange with some ambient medium, such as wind or corona. We will assume that the viscous stress zeroes at the surface. 

Dynamical equations we use below are derived from the stationary momentum (Navier-Stokes) equation
\begin{equation}\label{E:Euler}
\rho (\vector{v}\nabla) \vector{v} = - \nabla p - \rho \nabla \Phi - \nabla \mathrm{w},
\end{equation}
where ${\rm w}$ is the second-rank viscous stress tensor, components of which are assumed small with respect to pressure. We also suggest that, as poloidal velocity is everywhere smaller than azimuthal, only ${\rm w}_{r\varphi}={\rm w}_{\varphi r}$ and ${\rm w}_{z\varphi}={\rm w}_{\varphi z}$ should be taken into account. Together, these two assumptions imply that only the $\varphi$ component of equation~(\ref{E:Euler}) is affected by viscosity. 

Standard disc model uses all these assumptions, but only for vertically-integrated quantities, as the viscosity processes operating in real accretion discs are presumably determined by the characteristic spatial scales of accretion disc thickness. When viscosity is determined by microphysics (ionic or radiative viscosity), kinetic theory \citep{kinetics} predicts Newtonian-viscosity stress-strain relation (expressed in general Cartesian coordinates $i$, $j$, and $k$) of the form
\begin{equation}\label{E:stressstrain}
\displaystyle {\rm w}_{ik} = \left( \pardir{x_i}{v_k}+ \pardir{x_k}{v_i} - \frac{2}{3} \delta_{ik} \pardir{x_j}{v_j}\right) \nu \rho \simeq \left( \pardir{x_i}{v_k}+ \pardir{x_k}{v_i} \right) \nu \rho,
\end{equation}
where $\nu$ is viscosity coefficient determined by the characteristic spatial $l_{\rm t}$ and velocity $v_{\rm t}$ scales of the transfer process. In the case of turbulent viscosity, $l_{\rm t}$ is characteristic mixing length and $v_{\rm t}$ is characteristic turbulent viscosity. If magnetic fields dominate momentum transfer, these quantities may be understood as characteristic magnetic loop size and Alfv\'{e}n velocity. For meso-scale processes with $l_{\rm t} \sim H$, the stress-strain scaling should be more complex then in Newtonian approximation and may involve finite differences or spatially-averaged partial derivatives instead, but the direction of angular momentum transport should remain approximately the same, while the amplitude of the stress may vary. Thus equation~(\ref{E:stressstrain}) should still work well unless the transfer processes become anisotropic (such as anisotropic turbulent velocity field considered by~\citealt{wasiutynski}). In the latter case, $\nu$ is no more scalar, and the direction of viscous angular momentum transfer can differ from the direction of velocity gradient. This results in additional terms in viscous stress  (see, for instance,\citealt{tayler73} and \citealt{tassoul} chapter 8), that may change completely the angular momentum transfer in accretion discs if anisotropy is strong, as in convection-dominated flows \citep{QG00, igu02}. We will not consider the effects of anisotropic momentum transfer in this paper, except a brief discussion in Section~\ref{sec:disc:aniso}. 
%and, being strong enough, can stop stationary accretion as in convection-dominated flows \citep{QG00}.

For our case, the velocity field may be approximated as a differential rotation field, and
\begin{equation}
\frac{{\rm w}_{ik}}{\varpi \nu \rho} = \left(\vector{e}^\varphi_i \vector{e}^r_k + \vector{e}^r_i \vector{e}^\varphi_k\right) \pardir{\varpi}{\Omega} + \left(\vector{e}^\varphi_i \vector{e}^z_k + \vector{e}^z_i \vector{e}^\varphi_k\right) \pardir{z}{\Omega},
\end{equation}
where expression $\vector{e}^b_i$, for $b=\varpi$, $z$, or $\varphi$, is the $i$-th component of the corresponding (radial, vertical, or azimuthal) unit coordinate vector of the cylindrical coordinate frame. 
The relevant, azimuthal, component of the stress tensor gradient then becomes
\begin{equation}\label{E:wik}
\displaystyle \vector{e}^\varphi_i \nabla_k {\rm {\rm w}_{ik}} = \frac{1}{\varpi^2} \ppardir{\varpi}{\nu \rho \varpi^3 \pardir{\varpi}{\Omega}} + \varpi \ppardir{z}{\nu \rho \pardir{z}{\Omega}}.
\end{equation}
This expression is quite general, and the local $\alpha$-viscosity scaling may be reproduced by substituting $\nu \rho =\alpha p / |\nabla \Omega| \propto \varpi p/\Omega$. 

The angular momentum transfer equation is obtained as the azimuthal component of~(\ref{E:Euler})
\begin{equation}\label{E:angmo}
\frac{1}{\varpi}\rho v_\varpi \ppardir{\varpi}{\Omega \varpi^2} = e^\varphi_i \nabla_k {\rm {\rm w}_{ik}},
\end{equation}
where the right-hand side will be assumed to be given by~(\ref{E:wik}). In the
left-hand side, we neglected the term proportional to $v_z$, as
it is by a factor $\displaystyle \sim \left(\frac{H}{\varpi}\right)^2$ smaller
than the radial term.

The other two independent components of the momentum equation will be used to
solve for the vertical profiles of pressure and angular frequency. As poloidal
velocity components are small, and vertical gradients prevail over radial,
vertical component of momentum equation is simply hydrostatic equilibrium
condition
\begin{equation}\label{E:hyst}
\pardir{z}{p}=-\Omega_{\rm K}^2 z \rho.
\end{equation}
As the last of the three independent dynamical equations, it is convenient to use azimuthal component of the curl of equation~(\ref{E:Euler}). Neglecting poloidal velocity components, it can be written as (see also~\citealt{tassoul}, equation 27 in chapter 4)
\begin{equation}\label{E:oz}
\varpi \ppardir{z}{\Omega^2} = \ppardir{z}{\frac{1}{\rho}}\pardir{\varpi}{p} -  \ppardir{\varpi}{\frac{1}{\rho}}\pardir{z}{p}.
\end{equation}
Using equations~(\ref{E:hyst}) and (\ref{E:oz}) allows to calculate the vertical profiles of pressure and angular frequency given the vertical density profile. To recover $\rho$ as a function of $z$, an additional constraint is needed, that could be effective equation of state or energy equation. Both approaches will be considered in Section~\ref{sec:rot}. Note that existence of a global equation of state $p=p(\rho)$ makes angular frequency constant with height. 

\section{Rotation profile}\label{sec:rot}

\subsection{Analytical approximation}\label{sec:aansatz}

It is convenient to parameterize the vertical density profile as
\begin{equation}\label{E:rhoansatz}
\rho = \rho_{\rm c}(\varpi) \left( 1-\xi^2\right)^a,
\end{equation}
where $\xi = z/H$, and $a$ is a free parameter. Hydrostatic
equation~(\ref{E:hyst}) is then easy to integrate obtaining the
vertical pressure profile
\begin{equation}\label{E:verpressure}
p = p_{\rm c}(\varpi) \left( 1-\xi^2\right)^{a+1},
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}\label{E:pc}
p_{\rm c} = \frac{\Omega_{\rm K}^2 H^2}{2(a+1)}\rho_{\rm c}.
\end{equation}

In the barotropic case, our ansatz corresponds to a polytrope, and $a$ is the
polytropic index, $p=\rho^{1+1/a}$. In other cases it can be viewed as an
effective polytropic index. In particular, fully convective,
radiation-pressure-supported disc with $p\propto \rho^{4/3}$ is expected to
have $a=3$. As we will see below, $a=3$ is a good approximation even for
gas-dominated solutions. On the other hand, more sophisticated models of
vertical structure \citep{KS98,SSZ} predict $a\simeq 3$ for gas-dominated
discs and $a\simeq 1$ for radiation-pressure-dominated discs with
convection. Hence, different values of $a$ should be considered. 

%Substituting the above parameterization in equation~(\ref{E:oz}), it is possible to obtain the following expression for the vertical angular frequency gradient
In such a parameterization, equation~(\ref{E:oz}) takes the form
\begin{equation}\label{E:ozga}
\pardir{z}{\Omega} = \frac{a\Gamma_p-(a+1)\Gamma_\rho}{2(a+1)} \frac{z}{\varpi^2}  \Omega. %\frac{\Omega_{\rm K}^2}{\Omega},  
\end{equation}
Quantities $\Gamma_{p}$ and $\Gamma_\rho$ are logarithmic partial derivatives
of central pressure and density, respectively, with respect to $\varpi$. 
For the second derivative, neglecting the higher-order terms in $z/\varpi$, 
\begin{equation}\label{E:ozzga}
\pardirsec{z}{\Omega} \simeq \frac{a\Gamma_p-(a+1)\Gamma_\rho}{2(a+1)} \frac{1}{\varpi^2} \Omega, %\frac{\Omega_{\rm K}^2}{\Omega},
\end{equation}
constant with height as long as the effective polytrope index $a$ is constant. Integration of (\ref{E:ozga}) yields the following, Gaussian angular velocity profile
\begin{equation}\label{E:oga}
\displaystyle \Omega = \Omega_{\rm c} e^{\frac{a\Gamma_p-(a+1)\Gamma_\rho}{4(a+1)} \frac{z^2}{\varpi^2}},  
\end{equation}
where $\Omega_{\rm c}$ is the midplane rotational frequency, equal to Keplerian with an accuracy $\sim (H/\varpi)^2$. 
Evidently, the sign of $a\Gamma_p-(a+1)\Gamma_\rho$ defines the shape of the isostrophes (surfaces of constant $\Omega$) in the disc near the equatorial plane. Generally, the sign of this combination is negative, hence the isostrophes are convex. 
%The change in sign arises from the fact that closer to the surface, vertical gradient approaches zero and rotation is effectively pseudo-barotropic. 

Important special case not covered by the parameterization used here but easily derivable as the limit $a\to \infty$ is isothermal disc. Density profile has Gaussian shape in this case, hence there is no surface where density approaches zero. Angular frequency derivative becomes
\begin{equation}\label{E:ozga:iso}
\left.\pardir{z}{\Omega}\right|_{\rm isothermal} = \left(\Gamma_p-\Gamma_\rho\right) \frac{z}{\varpi^2} \Omega. %\frac{\Omega_{\rm K}^2}{\Omega}.
\end{equation}
If pressure decreases with the radial coordinate more rapidly than density, isostrophes are convex, and vertical shear transports angular momentum upwards. 

\subsection{Numerical solution}\label{sec:num}

It is possible to use a more physical approach by replacing the effective
polytrope with assumptions about heat release, radiative transfer and
opacity. Vertical structure of thin accretion discs was calculated in a number
of papers like \citet{KS98,SSZ}, but here we also track the vertical profile
of angular velocity $\Omega(z)$. To check the validity of the
effective-polytrope approach for predicting rotational structure and angular
momentum transport, we considered the particular case of viscous stress
independent of height. This is a reasonable assumption if effective viscosity
is provided by magnetic fields (see below Section \ref{sec:angmo}). Details of
the vertical structure model are given in
Appendix~\ref{sec:app:vert}. Dimensionless mass accretion rate is $\dot m
=1$. We normalize the mass accretion rate as $\dot m = \frac{\dot M c^2}{L_{\rm
         Edd}} = \frac{\dot M \varkappa_{\rm T} c}{4\pi GM}$, where
     $\varkappa_{\rm T}\simeq 0.34{\rm cm^2 g^{-1}}$ is Thomson electron
     scattering opacity. Same definitions are used in
     Appendix~\ref{sec:app:vert}.

\begin{figure*}
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{vestres}
 \caption{Vertical structure of constant-stress accretion in
   radiation-pressure- (left panels) and gas-pressure-dominated

   distance from the central object $\varpi = 100$ and
   $1000\,\frac{GM}{c^2}$. Upper, middle and lower panels show density
   profiles, angular frequency variations, and radial velocities,
   respectively. Velocities are normalized over characteristic values.

   lower panels correspond to radial and vertical shear contributions to
   radial velocity (shown in black solid). }\label{fig:verstre:ab}       
\end{figure*}

In Fig.~\ref{fig:verstre:ab}, we show the sample vertical structure for accretion discs with different input parameters, corresponding to different cases of standard disc accretion, particularly to electron-scattering, radiation- and gas-pressure-dominated zones A and B. To calculate $\Omega$, we integrated equation~(\ref{E:oz}) together with the vertical structure equations, assuming power-law dependences on radius for all the midplane quantities. If the vertical structure is described by universal functions of $z/H$, the variation of disc thickness $H$ with radius does not affect equation~(\ref{E:oz}) as the terms containing ${\rm d}H/{\rm d}\varpi$ cancel out:
\begin{equation}
\displaystyle \pardir{\xi}{\ln \Omega} = \frac{1}{2\varpi^2 \Omega^2} \frac{p}{\rho} \left( - \Gamma_p \pardir{\xi}{\ln \rho}+\pardir{\xi}{\ln \rho }\pardir{\xi}{\ln p} \Gamma_H + \Gamma_\rho \pardir{\xi}{\ln p} - \pardir{\xi}{\ln \rho }\pardir{\xi}{\ln p} \Gamma_H\right) = \frac{1}{2\varpi^2 \Omega^2} \frac{p}{\rho} \left( \Gamma_\rho \pardir{\xi}{\ln p}- \Gamma_p \pardir{\xi}{\ln \rho} \right).
\end{equation}

As it can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:verstre:ab}, effective polytrope with $a=3$ is a reasonable estimate for the disc solution with $\nu \rho = const$ and, probably, for real discs whenever vertical convection does not play important role. 

\section{Angular momentum transport}\label{sec:angmo}

Angular momentum transport is governed by two terms, advective and viscous
(the left- and right-hand sides of equation~\ref{E:angmo}), that should
exactly cancel in stationary case, as angular momentum is a conserved
quantity. This allows to estimate the radial velocity as a function of height
using equation~(\ref{E:angmo}). For a thin disc, it is safe to replace
$\Omega$ with $\Omega_{\rm K}$ (that is of course not true for second
derivatives with height). 

\subsection{Barotropic rotation}

This is the case when for some reason the matter of the disc has a global barotropic equation of state. 
%[when? Polish doughnuts? Convective discs? could accretion discs be degenerate? Yes, discs may be degenerate, see Paczynski&Jaroszynski 1978, if there is no turbulent/magnetic viscosity; but shouldn't they become self-gravitating first?]
As we will see later, some of the basic properties of barotropic models may be extrapolated to the more general case when $\Omega$ variation with height is allowed for. 

As it is stated by Poincar\'{e}-Wavre's theorem (see \citealt{tassoul},
section 4.3), angular frequency in a stationary barotropic differentially
rotating flow is a function of the cylindrical radial coordinate only. If
$\Omega=\Omega(\varpi)$, the second term in the right-hand side of
equation~(\ref{E:wik}) becomes zero. For Keplerian rotation, this implies
\begin{equation}\label{E:barwik}
\displaystyle \left(e^\varphi_i \nabla_k {\rm {\rm w}_{ik}}\right)_{\mbox{barotropic}} = -\frac{1}{\varpi^2}\ppardir{\varpi}{{\rm w}_{r\varphi} \varpi^2}.
%= -\frac{3}{2} \left( \Gamma_\nu + \Gamma_\rho + \frac{1}{2} + 2\Gamma_H (a+t) \xi^2\right)\frac{\nu\rho\Omega}{\varpi}.
\end{equation}
As it is easy to see, the sign of the whole expression, and, subsequently, the
radial velocity in the midplane is defined by the radial dependence of the
local viscous stress: if ${\rm {\rm w}_{\varpi \varphi}}\varpi^2$ decreases
with radius, there will be a counterflow in the midplane. If rotation is close
to barotropic, this quantity is also representative for mean radial velocity.  
In particular, local-alpha approach predicts
\begin{equation}\label{E:barvr}
v_\varpi = - \frac{2\alpha}{ \Omega \varpi^2 \rho}\ppardir{\varpi}{p \varpi^2}.
\end{equation}
One of the consequences is that if the variables are separable and equation of
state is barotropic (or pseudo-barotropic), the sign of radial velocity does
not change with vertical coordinate. The sign of the radial velocity is
defined by pressure dependence on $\varpi$. If $\Gamma_p < -2$, the sign
of $v_\varpi$ is positive, and accretion is
impossible. Expression~(\ref{E:barvr}) does not rely on the thinness of the
disc as long as $z\ll \varpi$, hence it is also valid, for instance, for the
midplane of a thick barotropic torus. For a geometrically thick, locally
viscous barotropic solution it states that a midplane outflow will be present
if the pressure decreases rapidly enough with distance. From dimensional
arguments, the radial pressure dependence in thick discs with $H\propto
\varpi$ may be shown to depend on radius as $p\propto \varpi^{-5/2}$. 
Most of the self-similar solutions for thick discs such as the advective disc
of \citet{NY95} and slim-disc models at large mass accretion rates
\citep{slim} reproduce this dependence. Thus, thick barotropic locally-viscous
discs should have equatorial outflows. 

\subsection{General case of isotropic viscosity}

A more comprehensive and realistic assumption is that the angular momentum
flux is proportional to the local angular velocity gradient, and to use the
vertical rotation profile derived in Section~\ref{sec:rot}. Radial dependence
of angular frequency is assumed Keplerian $\Omega \propto \varpi^{-3/2}$, as
deviations from the Kepler's law are of the order
$\left(H/\varpi\right)^2$. We will also use the effective polytropic scaling
proposed in Section~\ref{sec:aansatz}. Vertical viscosity profile will be
described through the free parameter $t$, $\nu \propto (1-\xi^2)^t$.  For angular momentum flux, we can
rewrite equation~(\ref{E:wik}) as
\begin{equation}\label{E:ozwik}
\displaystyle e^\varphi_i \nabla_k {\rm {\rm w}_{ik}} = \left(-\frac{3}{2} \left( \Gamma_\nu + \Gamma_\rho + \frac{1}{2} + 2\Gamma_H (a+t) \frac{\xi^2}{1-\xi^2}\right)+ \frac{a\Gamma_p -(a+1)\Gamma_\rho}{2(a+1)}\left(1-2(a+t)\frac{\xi^2}{1-\xi^2}\right)\right)\frac{\nu\rho\Omega}{\varpi}.
\end{equation}
Here, additional terms proportional to $\xi^2/(1-\xi^2)$ arise from $\nu\rho$ dependence on height. 
Consequently, for the radial velocity structure, (\ref{E:angmo}) becomes
\begin{equation}\label{E:vrest}
\displaystyle v_\varpi = 2\frac{\nu}{\varpi} \left(A+C\frac{\xi^2}{1-\xi^2}\right),
\end{equation}
where 
\begin{equation}\label{E:acoeff}
A=\frac{a\Gamma_p -(a+1)\Gamma_\rho}{2(a+1)} - \frac{3}{2}\left( \Gamma_\nu + \Gamma_\rho + \frac{1}{2}\right)
\end{equation}
%B=\frac{a\Gamma_p -(a+1)\Gamma_\rho}{2(a+1)} \left( 2(a+t)-3\right),
%\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}\label{E:ccoeff}
C=-(a+t)\left( 3\Gamma_H+\frac{a\Gamma_p -(a+1)\Gamma_\rho}{a+1}\right).
\end{equation}
Coefficient $A$ has the physical meaning of normalized midplane velocity. The second term in~(\ref{E:vrest}) does not diverge at the surface of the disc if $t\geq 1$, because the viscosity itself $\nu \propto (1-\xi^2)^t$. Depending on the quantity of $t$, velocity may diverge at the surface, but the matter and angular momentum flux are always finite if $a+t\geq 0$. For different model setups, we give the values of $A$ and $C$ in table~\ref{tab:varpars}. 

\subsection{The role of vertical structure}

Of all the possible values of $a$ and $t$, two cases are most interesting: the
local-alpha case and the constant-stress case. First is important as the
simplest generalization of alpha assumption: viscous stress ${\rm
  w}_{r\varphi} = \frac{3}{2}\nu \rho \Omega$ is assumed proportional to local
pressure that is equivalent to $\Gamma_\nu + \Gamma_{\rho} -3/2 = \Gamma_p$
(that reproduces radial behaviour) and $t=1$ (vertical profile). The radial
scaling for $\Gamma_\nu$ should be also applicable in a more general case,
wherever the standard-disc assumption for vertically-integrated quantities ${\rm W}_{r\varphi} \propto \Pi$ holds.

The other possibility, vertically constant viscous stress, is reproduced by
assuming $a+t=0$ (as the stress is $\sim \nu \rho \Omega$). 
Physically it is better motivated than local-alpha. Magnetic
fields produced by non-linear MRI are expected to be relatively independent of
$z$ and easily transported between different $z$. Large-scale vertical
magnetic field should retain its strength to fulfill the flux conservation
rule, that suggests constant with height magnetic stresses created by
large-scale fields. Vertical structure for a
magnetized disc with magnetic field amplitudes independent of vertical
coordinate was considered by \citet{uzdensky13}. 
Models with $a+t\leq 0$, however, can not reproduce correctly the dynamics of
a standard disc, as there is an angular momentum flux through the surface. A
compromise we will use in this paper where we restrict ourselves to
conservative solutions is to consider the right limit $a + t \to +0$. 
% [some more justification] 

As in the barotropic case, radial velocity in this case does not depend on
$z$, 
\begin{equation}\label{E:vrest:const}
\displaystyle v_\varpi^{\mbox{constant stress}} = 2\left(\frac{a\Gamma_p -(a+1)\Gamma_\rho}{2(a+1)} - \frac{3}{2}\left(\Gamma_p + 2\right)\right) \frac{\nu}{\varpi}.
\end{equation}
Depending on the radial structure of the disc and on the value of $a$, the
value of $v_\varpi$ and its sign may be different. In table~\ref{tab:varpars},
we consider several cases important for disc accretion. Along with the
standard-disc zones a, b, and c (see \citealt{SS73}) with different
assumptions about the vertical structure in density and viscosity, we apply
our calculations for the self-similar scalings of a thick quasi-spherical disc
and find that, for a broad range of possible parameters, midplane velocity and
pressure-weighed radial velocity (the importance of which will be shown in
Section~\ref{sec:heat}) is mostly positive. This is in contrast with the
classical zone a where the radial velocity is always negative. In
gas-pressure-dominated discs, radial velocity sometimes changes sign with
vertical coordinate, sometimes not. Except radiation-pressure-dominated thin
disc case, midplane velocity is always larger (either positive or smaller by
the absolute value) then average.

Apart from standard thin disc approximations, we estimate the properties of
the two disc models that in fact assume $H\sim R$. One of these scalings arise
if one assumes radial velocity scaling with $\Omega \varpi$ as in
advection-dominated solutions (in table~\ref{tab:varpars}, we refer to this
regime as to quasi-spherical). The other arises from the assumption of strong
radial convection. 
Convection-dominated discs \citep{QG00} tend to have $\Gamma_p \sim -3/2$,
hence a midplane outflow is not expected. However, the convection-dominated
solution assumes exact gyrentropic rotation throughout the volume of the
disc. Such an equilibrium requires strong convective motions, and neglects
other energy transfer processes that can affect the vertical and radial
structure of the model. Besides, convective models assume that the velocity
field can be easily separated into steady-state smoothly varying part and a
fluctuating part providing convective transport. As some simulations of thick
discs with convection show \citep{ECK88,igu02}, large convective cells may
contribute to velocity field even after averaging in time and radial
coordinate. Simulation results also suggest that convection is not efficient
enough to lead to gyrentropic rotation. 

\section{Radial heat transport}\label{sec:heat}

\subsection{Effective advection velocity}

If energy transfer is dominated by diffusive radiation transfer, and adiabatic
heating is neglected, energy equation may be written as follows
\begin{equation}\label{E:eneq}
\displaystyle \pardir{t}{\varepsilon} + \nabla \vector{F} = q,
\end{equation}
where $q$ is energy dissipation per unit volume, $\varepsilon$ is radiation
energy density, and $\displaystyle \vector{F}=-D\nabla \varepsilon +
\vector{v}\varepsilon$ is radiation energy flux consisting of a diffusion and
an advection parts. In the steady state, $\displaystyle
\pardir{t}{\varepsilon}$ disappears. To measure the effects of radial
advection and diffusion, we should integrate equation (\ref{E:eneq}) over $z$
taking into account the flux $Q_{\rm rad}$ radiated from the surface
\begin{equation}\label{E:QQ}
\displaystyle \ppardir{\varpi}{\int D \pardir{\varpi}{\varepsilon} dz - \int \varepsilon v_\varpi dz} = Q_{\rm rad}-Q_{\rm tot} ,
\end{equation}
where $Q_{\rm tot} = \int q dz$. 
This expression estimates the difference between the fluxes generated inside
the accretion disc and radiated from its surface. First term in the left-hand
side is suppressed when $\tau\gg 1$, but the second, advective, is potentially
important inside the disc. The advective term may be written as $Q_{\rm adv} =
\varepsilon \langle v_\varpi\rangle_\varepsilon$, where the velocity is
averaged with the weights proportional to the energy density
\begin{equation}\label{E:vaver:p}
\displaystyle \langle v_\varpi\rangle_\varepsilon = \frac{\int \varepsilon v_\varpi dz }{\int \varepsilon dz}.
\end{equation}
Evidently, averaging with $\varepsilon$ (or radiation pressure $p_{\rm rad} = \varepsilon/3$) does not in general produce the same result as averaging over $\rho$. As we should reproduce the standard disc equations after integrating the dynamical equations over $z$, 
\begin{equation}\label{E:vaver:rho}
\displaystyle \langle v_\varpi\rangle_\rho = \frac{\int \rho v_\varpi dz }{\int \rho dz}
\end{equation}
should be always negative, at least when $a+t>0$ and there is no stress at the disc surface. 

These suggestions are confirmed by direct integration in effective-polytrope approximation. For the velocity expressed by equation~(\ref{E:vrest}),
\begin{equation}
\displaystyle \frac{\dot M}{2\pi \varpi} = \Sigma \langle v_\varpi\rangle_\rho = \int \rho v_\varpi dz = \frac{2}{\varpi} \int \rho \nu \left( A+ C \frac{\xi^2}{1-\xi^2}\right) dz = \frac{2}{\varpi} \rho_{\rm c} \nu_{\rm c} H \left( \left(A-C\right) \gfun{a+t} + C \gfun{a+t-1}\right),
\end{equation}
where 
\begin{equation}
\displaystyle \gfun{n} = \int_{-1}^{1} (1-\xi^2)^n d\xi =  \frac{\sqrt{\pi}\Gamma\,(n+1)}{\Gamma\,(n+3/2)}.
\end{equation}
Substituting $A$ from~(\ref{E:acoeff}) and $C$ from~(\ref{E:ccoeff}), 
\begin{equation}\label{E:mdot}
\displaystyle % \frac{\dot M}{2\pi \varpi}
\Sigma \langle v_\varpi\rangle_\rho = -\frac{3}{\varpi} \rho_{\rm c} \nu_{\rm c} \gfun{a+t} \left( \Gamma_\nu +\Gamma_\rho + \Gamma_{\rm H} + \frac{1}{2}\right).
\end{equation}
The last bracket is proportional to $\ppardir{\varpi}{\nu\rho H \Omega
  \varpi^2} \propto \ppardir{\varpi}{{\rm W}_{r\varphi} \varpi^2}$ as it
should be in standard theory, and thus does not change sign in a stationary
case.
% should not change sign. 

The case of constant viscous stress should be treated separately. Equation~(\ref{E:mdot}) can not be reproduced by simply setting $t=-a$, because in this case angular momentum transfer is not conservative. However, it is possible to consider the above set of formulae in the limit $a+t\to +0$ which produces a different result. Indeed, it is easy to show that
\begin{equation}
\lim_{n\to +0} n \gfun{n-1}=1, 
\end{equation}
hence, for the constant-stress case, equation~(\ref{E:vrest}) becomes
\begin{equation}
\displaystyle %\frac{\dot{M}}{2\pi \varpi}
\langle v_{\varpi}\rangle_{\rho \mbox{, constant stress}}= \frac{2}{\varpi} \rho \nu \left( A+\frac{C}{2} \right),
\end{equation}
that is easily reduced to equation~(\ref{E:mdot}) if the values of $A$ and $C$
are substituted using equations~(\ref{E:acoeff}) and (\ref{E:ccoeff}). In this limit, the velocity field becomes unphysical: velocity is constant and, generally, different from the mean velocity value. 
In particular, radial velocity may be positive in every internal point, while
the mass transfer is dominated by the infinitely thin surface layer moving
inwards. It should be noted that, if in real accretion discs viscous stresses
are constant with height, there should be a non-negligible surface stress and
thus angular momentum transfer to wind or corona. In our formalism this
corresponds to direct substitution of $t=-a$ to equation~(\ref{E:ozwik})
before integration instead of approaching the limit as it was made above. In
this case, $\displaystyle v_\varpi = \frac{2A}{\varpi} \frac{\rho
  \nu}{\Sigma}$. If $A<0$, this is easily interpreted as angular momentum loss
from the disc surface, while the case of $A\geq 0$ does not have any evident
physical meaning as there should not be any angular momentum source at the
surface of the disc. 

For radiation-pressure-dominated regime, we can replace radiation energy density with pressure and calculate $\langle v\rangle_{\varepsilon}$ as
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{l}
\displaystyle \langle v_\varpi\rangle_{\varepsilon} = \frac{\int p v_\varpi dz}{\int p dz} = \frac{\nu_{\rm c}}{ H \gfun{a+1}}\left( (A-C) \gfun{a+t+1} + C \gfun{a+t}\right)  \\
\displaystyle \qquad{} =\frac{1}{a+t+\frac{3}{2}}\frac{\nu_{\rm c}\gfun{a+t}}{ H \gfun{a+1}}\left( -\frac{3}{2}  \left(a+t+1\right) \left(\Gamma_\nu + \Gamma_\rho +\frac{a+t}{a+t+1}\Gamma_H + \frac{1}{2}\right) + \frac{a\Gamma_p-(a+1)\Gamma_\rho}{2(a+1)} \right).\\
\end{array}
\end{equation}
For the particular case of ``local-alpha'' viscosity when local stress ${\rm w}_{r\varphi} \propto p$, $t=1$, and the radial gradients conforming to the quasi-spherical case $\Gamma_\rho = -3/2$, $\Gamma_{H}=1$, $\Gamma_p = -5/2$, $\Gamma_\nu = 1/2$:
\begin{equation}
\displaystyle \langle v\rangle_{\varepsilon, \mbox{ quasi-spherical, local-alpha}} = -\frac{3}{2} \frac{a^2-\frac{5}{3}a-1}{(2a+5)(a+1)} \frac{\nu_{\rm c}}{H},
\end{equation}
that changes sign at $a=(\sqrt{61}-5)/6\simeq 0.47$, the stiffer effective
polytrope corresponding to positive weighed velocity. Hence, pure
``local-alpha'' condition easily reproduces inward net advection, always but
for exotic, very stiff vertical structure. However, in the more realistic
assumption of vertically-constant viscous stress ($t=-a$),
\begin{equation}
\displaystyle \langle v\rangle_{\varepsilon, \mbox{ quasi-spherical, constant stress}} = \frac{1}{3} \frac{a+6}{(a+1)\gfun{a+1}} \frac{\nu_{\rm c}}{H},
\end{equation}
that is always positive for positive $a$. 
%All these calculations, including
%the constant-stress case, assume conservative accretion without any angular
%momentum flux through the disc surface. If the stress remains constant above
%the disc surface, vertical angular momentum transfer is enhanced by existence
%of a wind or corona rotating much slower and draining the disc of angular
%momentum. Here, we consider only conservative solutions. 

In Fig.~\ref{fig:verstre:ab}, we show not only the density profiles, but also
angular velocities and radial velocities calculated using
equations~(\ref{E:app:omega}) and (\ref{E:app:vr}), respectively. Effective
polytropic approximation with $a=3$ accurately predicts the profile of
$\Omega$, as well as the midplane value of $v_\varpi$, though the velocities
at larger heights may deviate strongly due to differences in density profile. 

The estimates made above should also be valid for optically thin, radiatively inefficient discs, if thermal conduction is ignored. 
Thermal conduction will level out temperature gradients, and the likely vertical structure will have $a\gg 1$ (with the case $a\to \infty$ corresponding to constant temperature). Large $a$ in a quasi-spherical disc means negative or positive $\displaystyle \langle v\rangle_{\varepsilon}$, depending on the energy release dependence on height. In all the cases, pressure-averaged radial velocity is larger than density-averaged. 

\subsection{Observational implications}

Consequences of non-trivial vertical structure may be well understood in the
standard approach to advective discs used, for instance, in
\citet{lipunova}. The difference between the radiation flux generated inside
the disc and that radiated from its surface is expressed through entropy
gradient as
\begin{equation}\label{E:qadv}
Q_{\rm adv} = \int v_\varpi \rho T \pardir{r}{s} dz,
\end{equation}
or, for radiation-pressure-dominated medium,
\begin{equation}\label{E:qadv:rad}
Q_{\rm adv} = \int v_\varpi \rho \left(\ppardir{r}{\frac{\varepsilon}{\rho}} +
\frac{1}{3} \varepsilon \ppardir{r}{\frac{1}{\rho}} \right) dz.
\end{equation}
If the variables are separable, the result is
\begin{equation}\label{E:qadv:separad}
Q_{\rm adv} = \gfun{a+1} \langle v_\varpi \rangle_\varepsilon  \Sigma\left(
\ppardir{\varpi}{\frac{3\Pi}{\Sigma}} + \Pi
\ppardir{\varpi}{\frac{1}{\Sigma}} + \frac{\Pi}{\Sigma} \pardir{\varpi}{\ln H}\right).
\end{equation}
Standard way to use this expression is to replace the mean radial velocity
with the density-averaged value (that also absorbs surface density). We
can estimate the effects of vertical structure by introducing a discrepancy
factor 
\begin{equation}\label{E:betafac}
\beta = \frac{\langle v_\varpi \rangle_\varepsilon}{\langle v_\varpi \rangle_\rho},
\end{equation}
and assuming power-law dependences on radius for $\Pi$ and $\Sigma$. Thus, 
\begin{equation}\label{E:qadv:betafac}
Q_{\rm adv} = -\gfun{a+1} \beta \left( 3\Gamma_\Pi - 4\Gamma_\Sigma+\Gamma_H\right) \frac{\dot{M}}{4\pi \varpi} \frac{\Pi}{\varpi\Sigma}. 
\end{equation}
The simplest observational manifestation arises from energy balance, $Q_{\rm
  tot} = Q_{\rm adv} + Q_{\rm rad}$. 
The observed effective temperature distribution will change affected by radial
heat transport as
\begin{equation}\label{E:qadv:teff}
\sigma_{\rm B} T_{\rm eff}^4 \simeq -\frac{3}{8\pi} \frac{GM\dot{M}}{\varpi^3}
\left( 1 - \frac{16}{15}\beta \frac{\varpi}{GM} \frac{\Pi}{\Sigma}\right).
\end{equation}
This is a rough estimate based on the supposedly power-law radial dependences
of all the quantities (we assumed $a=1$, $\Gamma_\Sigma = -1/2$, $\Gamma_\Pi =
-3/2$). It does however show clearly that the corrections that advection
introduces in the temperature profile of the disc depend on the ratio of 
average velocities, and change sign when $\langle v_\varpi
\rangle_\varepsilon$ becomes directed outwards. 

\section{Discussion}\label{sec:disc}

\subsection{Anisotropic and non-local viscosity}\label{sec:disc:aniso}

One principal assumption of this work is that viscosity is of Newtonian type, with the stress proportional to strain with equal proportionality coefficient in different directions. 
This case may be also described as isotropic viscosity, because isotropic turbulent motions reproduce this scaling, and the fourth-rank viscosity tensor reduces to a scalar. 
However, there are at least two cases when angular momentum transfer can be anisotropic: anisotropic turbulence (created, for instance, by convection) and large-scale magnetic fields. Small-scale chaotic magnetic fields can also produce anisotropic viscosity if their statistical properties favour certain directions in space. 

One one hand, anisotropic turbulence can easily change the direction of angular momentum transfer (as suggested by \citealt{wasiutynski}; for a very general but purely hydrodynamical consideration, see~\citealt{tassoul}, Section 8.5). On the other, chaotic magnetic fields produce viscous stresses proportional to strain components. Following \cite{ogilvie03}, off-diagonal magnetic stress components may be written in linear approximation as 
\begin{equation}
{\rm w}_{(\varpi,z)\varphi} \propto - \varpi B_{\varpi,z} B_\varphi \pardir{(\varpi,z)}{\Omega }.
\end{equation}
Stress components are thus proportional to the corresponding strains, and all the conclusions about the radial angular momentum transfer hold. However, the vertical term must in general be rescaled with the corresponding field component. Numerical simulations of MHD turbulence in saturated state suggest $B_{\varpi,z} \ll B_{\varphi}$ in Keplerian shear flows \citep{PB13}. Similarly, turbulent velocity dispersion is expected to be dominated by azimuthal motions \citep{ogilvie03}. For an anisotropic turbulent velocity field, $\varpi \varphi$-stress is proportional to 
\begin{equation}
\displaystyle {\rm w}_{\varpi \varphi} \propto \frac{1}{\varpi}\left\langle v_{\mbox{turbulent}, r}^2\right\rangle \ppardir{\varpi}{\varpi^2 \Omega} - 2\left\langle v_{\mbox{turbulent}, \varphi}^2\right\rangle \Omega.
\end{equation}
Angular momentum transfer direction for predominantly azimuthal velocity field has thus the same direction as for the isotropic case, but becomes proportional to $\Omega$ rather than its derivative. 

Angular momentum transfer becomes non-local if the spatial scales of the
magnetic loops and mixing lengths for turbulent motions become comparable to
or larger than disc thickness. In the limiting case of large-scale dynamically
important magnetic fields, ${\rm w}_{\varpi z}$ stress component should be
important. In particular, ${\rm w}_{\varpi z}$ is likely responsible for the
smooth radial velocity profile, very weakly dependent on $z$, in some of the
MHD simulations \citep{sadowski14,sadowski16,jiang14}. 
At the same time, certain simulations of thin ($H/R \sim 0.1$) MHD accretion
discs (such as \citealt{zhustone}) tend to reproduce the vertical profiles of
radial velocities. Possibly, some disc thickness effects smooth out the radial
velocity profiles. 

%\subsection{Simulation results}

%[about thin, mostly protoplanetary, discs]
%[underfed discs]

%Older simulations of optically and geometrically thick discs with radiation generally show a picture of violent convection inside the disc and a conical outflow from its surface \citep{ECK88, INA03}. Averaged in time, smaller convective cells disappear, and a general picture of meridional circulation with a midplane outflow emerges, supporting the point of view that thick discs generally have equatorial outflows. 
%However, recent works by \citet{sana16,...} suggest predominantly radial inward motions near the equatorial plane [why? outflows?]. 

%Geometrically thick, radiatively inefficient accretion flows are known to be convectively unstable \citep{NY94,QG00}. Purely radial convection alters the direction of angular momentum transport and is inconsistent with non-zero mass accretion rate. 

\subsection{Effects of disc thickness}

Directly, effects of disc thickness are not expected to affect much the results given in this paper. The equation for angular momentum transfer (equation~\ref{E:wik}) as well as the vertical derivative of angular frequency estimate (equation~\ref{E:oz}) are valid in general case. All the results near the equatorial plane hold, though the midplane value of angular frequency may change significantly. In particular, the statement about the midplane outflow does not rely strongly on the assumption about disc thickness as all the neglected terms are proportional to $\left(z/\varpi\right)^2$ rather than to $\left(H/\varpi\right)^2$. 

A potentially important issue is the poloidal velocity field. We neglected the vertical motions in the disc. Again, they should be negligible near the midplane, but at $z\sim H$ the impact of $v_z$ is important. Equation~(\ref{E:angmo}) becomes
\begin{equation}\label{E:zangmo}
\frac{1}{\varpi}\rho v_\varpi \ppardir{\varpi}{\Omega \varpi^2} + \varpi \rho v_z \pardir{z}{\Omega}= e^\varphi_i \nabla_k {\rm {\rm w}_{ik}}.
\end{equation}
For a conservative disc, vertical velocities should follow the changes in disc thickness, approximately as $\displaystyle v_z = \Gamma_H \frac{z}{\varpi} v_\varpi$. If we still expect the variables to be separable, total angular momentum fluxes should be zero everywhere, that allows to construct a simple two-dimensional model for angular momentum transfer in a thick disc
\begin{equation}\label{E:vr:thick}
\displaystyle \nu \rho \varpi^2 \pardir{\varpi}{\Omega} = - \rho v_\varpi \Omega \varpi^2,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{E:vz:thick}
\displaystyle \nu \rho \varpi^2 \pardir{z}{\Omega} = - \rho v_z \Omega \varpi^2,
\end{equation}
that implies the vertical velocity of
\begin{equation}
\displaystyle v_z = \frac{a\Gamma_p - (a+1)\Gamma_\rho}{2(a+1)\Gamma_\Omega} \frac{z}{\varpi} v_\varpi .
\end{equation}
Evidently, there is no physical reason for this vertical velocity to equal
$\displaystyle \Gamma_H \frac{z}{\varpi} v_\varpi$, as the vertical structure
is not constrained by disc thickness alone. Fine-tuning is required for a
thick disc to remain conservative. 
Another way to understand this inconsistency is that, to zero the angular
momentum flux through the disc surface, isostrophes should be normal to the
disc surface. On the other hand, the shapes of the isostrophes depend on
viscosity and entropy gradient. In particular, if dissipation in
the disc is arbitrarily small, angular frequency is constant on practically 
cylindrical surfaces, that
makes a conservative flared, conical or toroidal disc impossible. 
Therefore, in general case, and especially for $H\sim \varpi$, 
angular momentum transfer demands angular momentum
exchange with wind or corona. 

\section{Conclusions}

We conclude that, in a thin accretion disc with local, isotropic viscosity and no angular momentum loss from the surface, poloidal velocity field is strongly affected by meridional circulation. The principal quantity is the radial slope of the midplane viscous stress ${\rm w}_{r\varphi}$. If the stress decreases with radius as ${\rm w}_{r\varphi}\propto \varpi^{-2}$ or faster, a midplane outflow is possible. 

Existence of a midplane outflow in geometrically thick accretion discs should be important for advection effects, especially for very high (super-Eddington) mass accretion rates, when optical depth is large and temperature grows rapidly toward the equatorial plane. In thick discs one should expect the viscous stress to depend on the radial coordinate as ${\rm w}_{r\varphi}\propto \varpi^{-5/2}$ that evidently should lead to an outflow.
Depending on the details of vertical structure, energy dissipation and transfer, advective heat flux may be dominated either by the overall radial velocity directed inwards or by the equatorial counterflow. The effective radial velocity of heat transfer may differ from the density-averaged velocity by a factor of several. The effective radial velocity of heat transfer may differ from the density-averaged velocity by a factor of several.

Here, we will consider the vertical structure for the particular case of
constant dissipation with height, $\nu \rho = const$. 
Basic equations are vertical hydrostatic equilibrium
\begin{equation}
\frac{dp}{dz} = - \Omega^2 \rho z,
\end{equation}
optical depth growth
\begin{equation}
\frac{d\tau}{dz} = - \varkappa \rho,
\end{equation}
where $\varkappa$ is (Rosseland) opacity, with contributions from free-free absorption and free electron scattering taken into account. Fick's law for radiation diffusion
\begin{equation}
F = - \frac{c}{\varkappa \rho} \frac{d}{dz}\left( p_{\rm r} \right)
\end{equation}
where $\displaystyle p_{\rm r} = \frac{4\sigma_{\rm SB}}{3c} T^4$ is radiation pressure,
and dissipation law
\begin{equation}\label{E:diss}
\frac{dF}{dz} =  \frac{1}{2}\nu \rho \left( \varpi
\pardir{\varpi}{\Omega}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2} \nu \rho \Omega^2 \left(
\frac{9}{4} + \left(\frac{a\Gamma_p - (a+1)\Gamma_\rho}{2(a+1)}\frac{z}{\varpi}\right)^2\right)\simeq \frac{9}{8} \nu \rho \Omega^2.
\end{equation}
Below we will neglect the $O(z/\varpi)^2$ term. 
Angular frequency is assumed indistinguishable from Keplerian and constant
with height (only deviations in second derivative $\pardirsec{z}{\Omega}$ are important in our assumptions). Together with constancy of dissipation, it allows to integrate equation~(\ref{E:diss}) directly as
\begin{equation}\label{E:dissint}
F = \frac{9}{8}\nu \rho \Omega^2 z.
\end{equation}

Density may be normalized as follows:
%\begin{equation}
%\xi = \frac{z}{H},
%\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\rho = \frac{\Sigma}{H} \tilde\rho= \frac{2 \tau_0}{\varkappa_T H} \tilde\rho,
\end{equation}
where $\varkappa_{\rm T}\simeq 0.34{\rm cm^2 \,g^{-1}}$ is Thomson opacity, and $\tau_0=\varkappa_{\rm T} \Sigma /2 $
is the total Thomson opacity from the equatorial plane to the infinity along
the vertical coordinate. Analogously,
\begin{equation}
p = \frac{2\tau_0 H \Omega^2}{\varkappa_T} \tilde p, 
\end{equation}
where $c_{\rm s} = \Omega H / c$. The same normalization will be used for radiation pressure. 
The kinematic viscosity is determined by the largest scales and largest velocities reachable for MHD turbulence, hence $\nu \sim H c_{\rm s}$. It is convenient to use the same normalization as for pressure for the quantity
\begin{equation}
\nu \rho \Omega = \alpha  \frac{2\tau_0 H \Omega^2}{\varkappa_T},
\end{equation}
where $\alpha$ is a free parameter similar in physical meaning to the thin-disc $\alpha$ parameter. 

Total energy release allows to link the mass accretion rate with disc thickness as
\begin{equation}
\frac{3}{8\pi} \frac{GM\dot{M}}{R^3}= F = \frac{9}{8} \nu \rho \Omega^2 H,
\end{equation}
where we neglected the correction multiplier important near the disc's inner
edge. Dimensionless mass accretion rate defined as $\displaystyle \mdot =
\frac{\varkappa_T c \dot{M}}{4\pi GM}$ and midplane sonic velocity $c_{\rm s}$
(in $c$ units) may be expressed from each other as 
\begin{equation}
\mdot = \frac{3}{2} \alpha \tau_0 c_{\rm s}^2 r^{3/2}.
\end{equation}

Finally, the system of equations takes the form
\begin{equation}
\frac{d\tilde p_{\rm r}}{d\xi} = -\frac{9}{4}\alpha \tau_0 c_{\rm s} \frac{\varkappa}{\varkappa_{\rm T}} \tilde \rho \xi,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\frac{d \tilde p}{d\xi} = - \xi \tilde \rho,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\frac{d\tau}{d\xi} = -2\tau_0 \frac{\varkappa}{\varkappa_{\rm T}} \tilde \rho,
\end{equation}
where $\tilde \rho$ is found as a function of total and radiation pressure as
\begin{equation}
\tilde \rho = \frac{m c^2}{k} \left(\frac{2\sigma_{\rm B} \varkappa_{\rm T}
  GM}{3c^5} \frac{1}{\tau_0 c_{\rm s}}\right)^{1/4} r^{3/8} c_{\rm s}^2
\frac{\tilde p - \tilde p_{\rm r}}{\tilde p_{\rm r}^{1/4}} \simeq 1.06\times 10^5 \left(\frac{M}{\Msun}\right)^{1/4} \tau_0^{-1/4} c_{\rm s}^{7/4} r^{3/8} \frac{\tilde p - \tilde p_{\rm r}}{\tilde p_{\rm r}^{1/4}}.
\end{equation}
Here, $m$ is the mean mass of a particle, set to $0.6$ of a proton mass that is a good approximation for a fully ionized solar metallicity plasma. Boundary conditions for the pressure may be set at the photosphere. For total pressure, from the hydrostatic equation, 
\begin{equation}
\displaystyle p(\tau=1) = \frac{GMH}{\varkappa R^3},
\end{equation}
that corresponds, for the normalized quantity, to 
\begin{equation}
\displaystyle \tilde{p}(\tau=1) = \frac{1}{2\tau_0} \frac{\varkappa_{\rm T}}{\varkappa}.
\end{equation}
At the same time, radiation pressure is determined by the local gas temperature, equal to effective temperature at $\tau\simeq 2/3$. As most of the disc has very large optical depth, the difference between $\tau=0$, $2/3$, and $1$ is insignificant. Therefore, we can set
\begin{equation}
p_r(\tau=1) = \frac{4\sigma}{3c} T_{\rm eff}^4,
\end{equation}
that corresponds, for the normalized quantity, to 
\begin{equation}
\tilde{p}_r(\tau=1) = \frac{3}{2}\alpha c_{\rm s}.
\end{equation}
Thomson optical depth needs to be $\tau_0$ in the equatorial plane, that sets constrain on the only free parameter of the model, $\tau_0$. 

Once the density and pressure are known as functions of vertical coordinate, rotation profile may be expressed using equation~(\ref{E:oz}) and normalizations introduced in this Appendix
\begin{equation}\label{E:app:omega}
\displaystyle \pardir{\xi}{\ln \Omega} = \frac{H^2}{2\varpi^2} \frac{\tilde p}{\tilde \rho} \left( \Gamma_\rho \pardir{\xi}{\ln \tilde p} - \Gamma_p \pardir{\xi}{\ln \tilde \rho}\right) = \frac{1}{2} c_{\rm s}^2 \frac{\varpi c^2}{GM}\frac{\tilde p}{\tilde \rho} \left( \Gamma_\rho \pardir{\xi}{\ln \tilde p} - \Gamma_p \pardir{\xi}{\ln \tilde \rho}\right).
\end{equation}
Finally, after solving for the vertical structure, radial velocity may be calculated as
\begin{equation}\label{E:app:vr}
v_\varpi = 2\frac{\nu_c}{\varpi} \left( -\frac{3}{2}\left( \Gamma_\nu +
\Gamma_\rho + \frac{1}{2}\right)+\pardirsec{\xi}{\ln \Omega}\right) = 2\alpha
c_{\rm s}^2 \sqrt{\frac{\varpi c^2}{GM}} \left( -\frac{3}{2}\left(\Gamma_\nu +
\Gamma_\rho + \frac{1}{2}\right)+\pardirsec{\xi}{\ln \Omega}\right).
\end{equation}
