FEATURES:
---------

- **blazingly fast**.
- both **scalar and vector transforms**.
- backward and forward (synthesis and analysis) functions.
- flexible truncation (degree, order, azimuthal periodicity).
- spatial data can be stored in latitude-major or longitude-major arrays.
- various conventions (normalization and Condon-Shortley phase).
- can be used from **Fortran, c/c++, and Python** programs.
- highly efficient Gauss algorithm working with Gauss nodes (based on
  Gauss-Legendre quadrature).
- support for SSE2, SSE3, **AVX, AVX2** vectorization, as well as Xeon Phi and
  Blue Gene/Q.
- **parallel transforms with OpenMP**.
- synthesis (inverse transform) at any coordinate (not constrained to a grid).
- **on-the-fly transforms** : saving memory and bandwidth, they are even faster
  on modern architectures.
- accurate up to spherical harmonic degree l=16383 (at least).
- **rotation** functions to rotate spherical harmonics.
- special spectral operator functions that do not require a transform
  (multiply by cos(theta)...).
- scalar transforms and rotations for complex spatial fields.
- SHT at fixed m (without fft, aka Legendre transform - beta).


INSTALL:
--------

Briefly, the shell commands `./configure; make; make install` should
configure, build, and install this package. `./configure --help` will
list available options (among which `--enable-openmp` and `--enable-python`).
However, in order to get the best performance, it is highly recommended to
compile and install the FFTW library yourself, because many distributions
include a non-optimized FFTW library.

	  with --enable-magic-layout (thanks to Bertrand Putigny)

* v2.7  (24 Feb 2017)
	- Faster vector transforms: up to 2 times faster.
	- Optimized pseudo-spectral rotation functions: 4 to 6 times faster (single thread).
	- Improvements in complex spatial data support (flexible truncation + rotations).
	- DCT-based transforms on regular grids have been removed.

	- Improved `SH_to_lat()` function, now also included in the Python interface.
	- Regular grid and DCT-based transform are deprecated and disabled by
	  default (enable with --enable-dct).

	- configure script now accepts `FC=` to specify Fortran compiler.

* v2.6.5  (24 Aug 2015)
	- critical bugfix (multiple transforms of different lmax failed sometimes) [issue #20].
	- faster DCT initialization when using multiple threads.

* v2.6.4  (25 Jul 2015)
	- a critical bugfix (segfault of fixed-m tranforms when mmax=0).
	- fixed-m Legendre transforms added to Fortran API.

	- better default compilation flags for icc.
	- complex transforms added to Fortran API (thanks to Bertrand Putigny)

	  a (-1)^m for m<0 [issue #16].
	- fix: segfault in `spat_to_SH_ml()` [issue #15].
	- fix a few compilation issues.

* v2.6  (24 Oct 2014)
	- support for IBM Blue Gene/Q (QPX) with [bgclang](http://trac.alcf.anl.gov/projects/llvm-bgq).
          Configure with `./configure --enable-many-core CC=bgclang`

	- fix: a few compilation problems.

* v2.5  (13 Mar 2014)
	- new experimental support for Intel Xeon Phi (MIC) in native mode,
	  with contributions from Vincent Boulos (Bull). For good performance
	  icc 14 is required. Configure with `./configure --enable-mic CC=icc`
